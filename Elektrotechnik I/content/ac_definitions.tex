	\emph{Alternating current} signals vary periodically in time.
	
	\begin{description}
		\item[Instantaneous Value:] magnitude of a waveform at any instant of time, denoted by lower-case letters ($e_1$, $e_2$)
		\item[Peak Amplitude:] maximum value of a waveform \emph{measured from its average} ($E_m$ for source voltage, $V_m$ for voltage drop across a load)
		\item[Peak Value:] maximum instantaneous value of a waveform \emph{measured from zero volt}
	\end{description}
	
	\[
		F = \nicefrac{1}{T} \sunit{\hertz} \quad, \qquad \omega = 2\pi \cdot F \sunit{\radian\per\second}
	\]
	
	The procedures known from DC analysis such as mesh or nodal analysis can be used in AC analysis with the only difference that we have to solve linear complex equations.
